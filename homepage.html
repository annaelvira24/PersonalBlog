                    <p> Hello! My name is Anna Elvira Hartoyo. Just an ordinary Computer Science student
                        who have big enthusiasm in visual arts. Currently I'm on my third year pursuing Informatics Engineering
                        Bachelor degree at Bandung Institute of Technology. I fell in love with art since
                        I was a kid. But since technology is growing rapidly nowadays, I decided to take 
                        this major. I really like to combine art and technology and bridging them technically.
                        <br/>
                        Cheers! 
                    </p>

                                <h3>COOK</h3>
                                <p>Cooking is good for mental health  and soul because cooking is an act of patience, 
                                    mindfulness, an outlet for creative expression, a means of communication, 
                                    and helps to raise oneâ€™s self esteem. I usually cook for myself and my family. Sweet dessert and 
                                    western food are my favorite things.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class = "card">

                                <br/>
                                <h3>CATS</h3>
                                <p>People say "Time spent with cat is never wasted". And I agree with it.
                                    I have five cats at my home. They need a lot of attention and affection. But, 
                                    that's what makes me feel relax during stressful times. 
                                </p>

                                <h3>VISUAL ART</h3>
                                <p>The earth without "art" is just "eh". Yes! Life without art would be just 
                                    a blank piece of paper. Me, myself is very passionate in visual arts.
                                    I love drawing, painting, and making graphic designs. For me, art is the
                                    best way to runaway without leaving home :)

                                        and allocated them to the team members. Anyway, I got 
                                        vast valuable experiences!
